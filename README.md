* I took on the challenge of writing the missing game elements.
* 
* original TODO list:
* - no bombs
* - no grazing (added score by scratching bullets)
* - 1 level only
* - 1 life only
* - final destination
* 
* added at this moment:
* - grazing points, scratching bullets multiplies with scores
* - 4 working levels, level system implemented. currently working on level 4
* - 10 health points, restored each defeated level
* - backgrounds and 3 new powerups: 6 weapon upgrades, bombs and spiralspellcard
* - 9 new enemies with new spellcards
* - new background music from original TouHou games
* - started script implementation
* 
* TODO list:
* - more spellcards, based on new mathematical formulas(polar coord, lemniscates, floral pattern, etc...)
* - background music
* - scrolling backgrounds, new locations and storyline
* - bomb mechanic
* - optimize scripts for max performance
* - Improve the looks of the HTML page (last job)
* 
* The game is a tribute to the TouHou series and I would like to keep the characters and story in the same context.
* Everyone is free to use the scripts at will however such as Sako intended while coding this game.
